# cswap.sh — one Claude account across the fleet (sd:7323).
#
# Remote Control sees only the sessions of the active account, so every
# machine must use the account the hub uses. The hub picks it; satellites
# follow. A local-cron-jobs job runs `sync` every minute on every machine
# (local-cron-jobs/examples/cswap-sync.job).
#
# Usage:
#   cswap.sh sync     lead or follow, by this machine's role
#   cswap.sh status   same account as the hub? (exit 0 yes, 1 no, 3 nothing to check)
#
# The role is the fence's: the machine whose `sd-db fence` reads holder (exit
# 0) leads, so a promoted satellite leads by itself. Any other answer follows.
# The account travels as its organizationUuid in the workflow database row
# sys.cswap_account (sd-plugin.json declares it); account numbers differ
# between machines, so they never travel.
#
# Flags for `cswap auto` live in cswap-auto.conf.
