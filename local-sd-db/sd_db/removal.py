"""Retire a repo or an item row through a supported verb (sd:754).

A remove is a plan and an apply. The plan only reads. It names every row the
verb would take, every reason it must refuse, the runner journal files the
apply moves after its commit, and the files and references it leaves, and it
hashes the rows and refusal keys into the fingerprint the apply must be handed
back (`design.md` sections 1, 3 and 4). The apply (`apply`, PR 2) plans again
under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, files the record (`_record`, section 4.1), deletes
children first, commits, and then moves the removed runs' journal files into
quarantine (section 4, step 7). `signal_stop` is the CLI's handler set, and
`records` is how a reader finds the record of a removed row (section 4.3).

The refusal codes are the design's: G for both verbs, A1 for assignment id
reuse, I for an item, P for a repo. G4 is not a plan refusal; `check_actor`
raises it, and the plans take no actor values (review round 4, C-61). G6 is
checked after the fingerprint and is not part of it (C-64). G7 is this
module's own, from the #350 review (N-4): a child table of one of the four
parents `SCANNED` names (`item`, `repo`, `assignment`, `runner_run`; the
#399 review, sd:956) the plan has no rule for, refused on both verbs like
G1. R1-R3 are the record's size refusals (section 4.2); like G6 they are
read after the fingerprint, because the chunks are derived from the rows the
fingerprint already covers.

A plan writes no row and no file, and nothing here opens a store: a plan and
an apply read through the connection they are handed, and find the store's
directory from that connection's `main` file, never from `home`.
