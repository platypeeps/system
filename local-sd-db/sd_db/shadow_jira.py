"""The Jira tracker: the same five-key contract, a completely different service.

Ported from the system dashboard's `jira_search`/`jira_me`/`collect_jira`, which
have been answering this question for months. Three things are carried over
verbatim because each was learned the hard way, and three are deliberately
changed. Both lists are here so the next reader can tell which is which.

**Carried over.**

* `myself` is the availability check, not the search. Bad credentials do not
  make a JQL search fail -- Jira answers 200 with `{"issues": [], "isLast":
  true}`, because `currentUser()` resolves to anonymous, who is assigned
  nothing. So the search cannot tell "your credentials are wrong" from "you have
  no open issues", and something else has to say which before it is believed.
* The account id, not the email address, is what issues are matched against.
  Jira hides `emailAddress` on any site with the privacy setting on, and an
  empty email compared against an empty email marks every issue as both assigned
  and filed.
* `watches.isWatching` is read rather than derived. Jira has already computed it
  for the authenticated user, so it stays correct even if someone points the JQL
  at a queue that is not theirs.

**Changed, and why.**

* **No default base URL.** The system dashboard falls back to a specific
  Atlassian host. This backbone must carry no employer footprint of any kind, so
  an unset `JIRA_BASE_URL` is "not configured" and never a guess. That is also
  the honest behaviour: a default host silently pointed at the wrong tenant is
  worse than a row saying which variable to set.
* **An https base URL or none.** Every request carries the token in a Basic
  `Authorization` header, so a base URL with any other scheme -- an `http://`
  typo included -- is refused as not configured, before any request, and the
  reason names the scheme and never the value. There is no localhost
  exception in the code; the tests that drive the real transport against
  127.0.0.1 servers replace `settings` to get past the check.
* **No credentials and no stray text in the authority.** A base URL with a
  `user:password@` part, with a port that is not a number from 1 to 65535, or
  that `urllib.parse` cannot split, is refused the same way. Otherwise
  `http.client` raises `InvalidURL` with the text after the last colon -- a
  password pasted into the URL -- in its message, and `urllib.parse` raises
  `ValueError` quoting the authority when it holds look-alike punctuation
  (a fullwidth `：` or `＠`) or a bracketed host that is not an address. The
  check reads the authority as `urllib` does, percent-decoded, so `%40` is an
  `@`, and then refuses any `%` left in it, so the value kept is the value
  checked. And the host must be a DNS name, an IPv4 address or a bracketed IPv6
  address with no zone: `urllib.parse` also admits `[v1.user:password]`, a
  zone such as `[fe80::1%25user:password]`, a second colon and a
  twice-encoded `%2540`, and each hands that text to the resolver, to a proxy
  and to a certificate-mismatch message that the reason keeps. The host
  must also be ASCII once decoded, and the reason says to write an
  international name in its `xn--` form. `http.client` writes the `Host`
  header as Latin-1, so `bücher` went out with a raw `0xFC` byte beside an
  SNI of `xn--bcher-kva`. And the stdlib `idna` codec that would convert it is IDNA
  2003, which names more than a thousand code points differently from IDNA
  2008 (`faẞ` is `fass` to it and `xn--fa-hia` to IDNA 2008), so a converted
  host could carry the token to a name the operator did not mean.
* **No redirect is followed.** `urllib`'s redirect handler copies every header,
  `Authorization` included, into the request it follows, to whatever host and
  scheme `Location` names -- so an https check alone would still hand the token
  on. A 30x is reported as a failed collect that names the redirect.
* **A transport failure is a failed collect, never an exception.** The
  request is built inside the `try`, and every `http.client.HTTPException`
  (`InvalidURL`, `BadStatusLine`, `IncompleteRead`, `RemoteDisconnected` and
  the rest) and every `ValueError` is caught with a reason that names the
  exception type alone, because their messages quote the URL or the bytes
  read. So `sync` still writes the heartbeat and its request count. A
  `URLError` or other `OSError` keeps its message, which says why the
  connection failed, unless the `URLError` wraps one of those exceptions;
  an `HTTPError` keeps Jira's reason phrase.
* **The window replaces the open-only filter.** The system dashboard's JQL asks
  for open issues, because it renders a worklist. An index wants the opposite:
  if closed issues never appear, a ticket that closes simply stops matching and
  its row keeps saying `open` forever. So the default JQL selects by involvement
  and recency, and lets the store record the close.
* **The window is expressed in relative minutes, never as a timestamp.** JQL
  date literals are interpreted in the *Jira account's* configured timezone,
  which this machine has no way to know; a `-90m` offset has no timezone to get
  wrong. This is the one place the port would have been a defect rather than a
  copy.
* **A window past the page ceiling is split, not restarted.** Truncated, the
  collect is not `ok` and the watermark stays put, so a first window with more
  issues than one walk returns would be asked again whole on every run.
  `search_window` halves it until each part fits, within `MAX_REQUESTS`.

Credentials come from the environment and nowhere else. This module never reads
another project's `.env`: standing rule 1 says the framework does not touch repo
files for its own purposes, and a credentials file belonging to a different
repository is the last place to make an exception.

**How it got here.** This is the pack's `dashboard/jira.py`, lifted whole on the
2026-09-12 decision on sd:361 -- the second tracker is built, not closed. Four
things changed and nothing else: `collect` returns `Collected` rather than the
pack's dict, so `sync` reads the same shape from both trackers; the timestamp
helpers are `shadow_sync`'s `iso` and `parse_iso`, because there is no
`dashboard` package here to import; `ok` folds truncation in, matching
`Collected`'s own rule, so the caller's watermark guard on `ok` alone is sound;
and `fetch_issue` stayed behind in the pack, where `sd-trackers ref` calls it.
Two more followed on review of the dispatch that made this module reachable:
the https-only base URL and the refused redirects above, and
`Collected.requests`, which counts every attempt, a failed one included --
even one that never reached a socket -- so the heartbeat reports Jira's traffic.
