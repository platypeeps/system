    that same descriptor, so nothing can be swapped in between the check and

    it has, which is what makes the private 0o600 of a file it creates safe to
    add: an existing lock is never chmodded under a live holder.

    `noun` names the lock in a refusal; `held` is the message when another

    `error` is the exception raised for every refusal. A non-blocking lock
