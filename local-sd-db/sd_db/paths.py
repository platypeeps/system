"""Repository paths: the stored key and the disk path (sd:1439).

The database stores a repository under the current `$HOME` as `~/` plus its
home-relative POSIX path, so a second machine with another login resolves
the same rows. A path outside `$HOME` stays absolute. That stored form is the
**key**. The **disk path** is what `git -C`, `cwd=` and `Path.exists` need.

A path becomes a key when it enters the library, and a key becomes a disk
path at the moment something touches the disk. Nothing else converts:

* `store` -- disk path or key in, key out. Every writer and every probe.
* `expand` -- key in, disk path out. Every disk use.
* `keys` -- the key plus the legacy absolute form, for `IN (...)` probes, so
  a row written before migration 014 still matches.
* `same` -- whether two paths name one repository, for comparisons in Python.
* `same_key` -- whether a repository value stored in JSON (a receipt, a
  proof, a journal) names the same repository as a column 014 rewrote.

`$HOME` is read at call time, as `database.default_path` does: tests set
`HOME` for themselves and their children, and a frozen home would leak the
real one into them. An unset or empty `$HOME` is an error and never a fall
back to the password database, because a wrong home fails open.

The conversion never runs inside SQL at query time. Under sd:1335 the SQL
runs on the hub, under the hub's home, and would answer a satellite wrongly.
The one exception is the migration, which runs only on the hub: `install`
registers two string functions on the connection `migrate` uses.
