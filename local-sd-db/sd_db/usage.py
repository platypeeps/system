"""`sd usage`: the month, printed from the read the Usage screen shows.

The verb is the one in `sd-db.sh` (the pack's `usage` group, when it lands,
calls `report` and prints the same text). It reads `read` -- `reads.usage_month`
under the registry's merged caps, one read, shared with the Usage screen and,
per bill, with Today's cost tile -- and writes nothing but the sweep (the
registry is consulted through `caps`, which parses the file and merges the
rows without `registry.read`'s first-open seeding, so no row is written on
the way): requirement 6 has a `reserved` row
whose owner is dead released, and a `sending` row whose owner is dead
settled to `bound`, "by the next reservation or by `sd usage`", so the verb
runs `ledger.release_orphans` before it reads, in the sweep's own committed
transaction, the one a reservation runs it in. `--json` prints the read and
nothing else, so a test can hold it to the screen's bytes.
