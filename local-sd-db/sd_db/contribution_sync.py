#: The requests one complete, unpaginated observation can make, so the loop
#: stops before an attempt that cannot finish. A pull reads itself, its
#: reviews, comments, inline comments, timeline, check runs and statuses,
#: then itself again, plus its head's workflow runs when its check names
#: repeat (sd:1776); an issue reads itself, its comments and its timeline,
#: then itself again. A merge dependency reads its pull, a release one adds the release,
#: the tag ref, one peel, the comparison, PyPI and the ref again, and an
#: issue one reads the issue and, unless that is closed as completed, one
#: page of the pull requests referencing it. An `item` dependency is
#: resolved in-process and priced so, not left out: `_cost` refuses a kind
#: this table does not name rather than reserving nothing for it.
#: Pagination costs more; an attempt the table underestimates fails on the
#: budget, is held on its own key, and rotates to the next run.
