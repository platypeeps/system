#: The job's exit code when the BACKUP PASSED but the SOURCE is referentially
#: broken. It is not 1, because 1 means the documented failure -- the library
#: raised, nothing was written, no prune ran -- and `sd-db.sh` mails that as
#: "sd-db backup FAILED". This run wrote a snapshot and verified it; calling it
#: a failed backup sends the operator looking for a snapshot that is on disk.
#: It is not 0 either: 0 is silent, and three silent nights over six orphan
#: rows is exactly what sd:744 was.
#:
#: It claims nothing about the checkpoint or the prune. BOTH returns below can
#: reach it, and the read-only-before-`migrate` path took neither -- it says
#: "prune skipped" on the same line. The summary says which ran; the exit code
#: carries the finding and only the finding.
#:
#: It is not 2, and that is the reason for the gap in the numbering.
#: `argparse` exits 2 for a usage error, so `--keep nope` leaves `main`
#: unreached, and `sd-db.sh` reads a status and not a traceback. On 2 the two
#: are indistinguishable and a typo mails "the source is referentially
#: broken".
