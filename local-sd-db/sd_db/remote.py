"""A connection to a database served by `sd_db.serve`, over one TCP socket.

The satellite half of the hub/satellite design
(`docs/work/2026-09-22-run-the-framework-from-a-second-machine/`). The hub
holds the file and opens it with the library's own local open; this class
forwards each statement and rebuilds the answer. It carries exactly the
connection and cursor surface the library touches, which
`sd_db.testing.surface` names and proves against the whole suite; anything
else raises `AttributeError`.

Steps 2 to 4 and 7 of the plan. On loopback, the `open` frame carries the
owner-only token the server wrote beside the database; on the tailnet, the
hub admits the session by its TCP peer and reads no token. It also carries
the handshake of step 3: this build's package version and `SCHEMA_VERSION`,
beside the protocol version every frame carries. The hub refuses any difference with
`BuildMismatch` before it opens anything.

Step 5, the unknown outcome. Over the wire the hub can commit and its answer
can still be lost. So every write transaction carries a request id R, a
ULID this class makes when it sends `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and sends again with
`COMMIT`; the frame's `rid` field. The hub owns R from `BEGIN` and records
it inside the transaction it commits. When the answer to `COMMIT` is lost,
this class asks the hub for R on a fresh session (`outcome`), with a
bounded backoff: `recorded` returns as a commit would, `absent` raises
`TransactionLost(R)`, and an owner still live at the bound raises
`UnknownOutcome(R)`. It keeps no copy of the statements and re-sends
nothing: the verb is run again, under a new id, by whoever chooses to. A
plain `BEGIN` carries no R; the hub runs it as a read transaction.

A write outside a transaction (sd:2671) carries an R too, and the hub runs
it as a write transaction of that one statement: a lost answer is settled
the same way. A `recorded` write returns no rows and no `lastrowid`, since
its answer is gone.

The frame is a 4-byte big-endian length and that many bytes of UTF-8 JSON.
JSON and not pickle: the hub will read frames from another machine, and a
pickle is code.
