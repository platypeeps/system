"""The provider registry: identity from the file, state from the rows.

One file, `~/.local/share/sd/providers.yaml`, says what a provider *is* --
its start line or URL, vendor, bill, reader, price, the environment
variables its process receives, and the two role lists. The `provider` and
`bill` tables say what has *changed* since: enabled, the reason it is not,
each role's automatic order, and a bill's cap. A checkpoint makes NULL ranks
explicit exclusions after the operator configures membership. The file seeds those tables on
the first read through a writable connection (`ensure_seeded`, which `read`
calls); a later writable read seeds only a provider or bill the file has
gained since, and never rewrites a row that exists. On every read the
library merges the two, so the pack's `sd-review` and the dashboard see one registry. A
read-only connection cannot seed and gets the merged view all the same,
which for an unseeded table is the file alone.

The split is the whole design. Identity in a file, because it is edited by
hand, reviewed in a diff and restored from a snapshot. State in rows, because
it is changed from a screen, at a moment, by someone who is not editing a
file.

Four refusals, all at read time, so a registry that cannot mean anything
never reaches a caller:

* A **capped bill with a `start` entry**. The library makes `url` calls
  itself and can refuse one before it is sent; it cannot refuse a spawned
  CLI's calls, so a cap on one is a number nothing enforces.
* **`author` and `reviewer` resolving to the same provider**, which is a
  review by the author.
* A **name that does not resolve**: a role list naming an unknown provider,
  a provider naming an unknown bill.
* **Unreadable explicit membership**: malformed policy or a missing provider
  row cannot silently restore automatic selection.

Nothing here special-cases a provider. An `exo` entry with a URL resolves
because every `url` entry resolves; that is criterion 3's second half, and it
is a property of having no table of known names rather than a feature.
