"""The fleet's branch protection, observed per registered repository.

`sd-status` reports protection for the repository enclosing the working
directory and, since R10-D6, for no other. There was therefore no single
answer to "which of my repositories actually enforce merge authority": a
repository with protection off was invisible until someone ran `sd-status`
inside it. This module is the fleet-wide answer, in the shape `sd_db` already
uses for GitHub facts -- a collector that writes rows, and a screen that reads
them. Nothing here is called from a request.

**Same doctrine, same names.** The gaps are the ones `sd-status` names, with
the same ids and, where practical, the same sentences: `enforce_admins`,
`required_checks`, `strict`, `required_not_produced`,
`produced_not_required`, `reviews`, `bypass`, the two merge-settings
flags `squash_message` and `rebase_merge`, and the two baseline flags
`protection_source` and `required_check` (sd:1741, below). `enforce_admins` is the classic
question -- are administrators themselves subject to the rules -- and a
ruleset answers it only through the bypass actors that reach
administrators: `OrganizationAdmin`, or the `RepositoryRole` that is admin.
A bypass for one GitHub App, a team or a deploy key leaves administrators
subject to every rule, so it is its own gap, `bypass`, naming the actor and
when it applies, and never "enforce_admins is off" (sd:1327 review, Codex
finding 2: that sentence on a correctly configured repository is a false
security finding). Either bypass is reported per ruleset with the gating
rules that ruleset carries, since a bypass of one ruleset reaches no other
ruleset's rules (Codex :730). Protection that exempts admins is
prose, not authority; a check the repository runs but does not require can go
red without blocking a merge. A reader who has learned one screen has learned
the other.

**Unknown is not protected, and a classic 404 is an answer only after the
rulesets answered, and only from an admin.** A repository is `protected` on
a 200 from the classic protection endpoint, or on a ruleset whose rules gate
what a merge lands (`pull_request`, `required_status_checks`) -- a branch a
ruleset protects answers 404 on the classic endpoint to its admin too, so
the 404 is never interpreted before the branch's rules are read. Then a 404
from a token with `admin` on the repository, with no gating rule, is "the
branch has no protection" and is `unprotected`. A 404 from any other token
is not: GitHub answers 404 `Not Found`, not 403, on classic protection to a
caller without `admin`, whether or not the branch is protected -- measured
2026-09-22 on home-assistant/core and gohugoio/hugo, both protected, both
404 -- while an admin of a bare branch gets 404 `Branch not protected`. That
404 is `unknown`, with the permission named as its reason; this file said
otherwise until sd:1327's review, and the collector filed every upstream
repository the operator does not administer as `unprotected` on no evidence.
The rules endpoint is readable without `admin` (home-assistant/core answers
its five rules to a token that gets 404 on classic), so a ruleset-protected
upstream repository is `protected` here and never `unknown`. Everything
else (a 403 on a private repository under a free plan, a
timeout, an exhausted budget, a malformed body, a remote that is not GitHub)
is `unknown` too, with the reason recorded, and never presented as safety.
A malformed body is one that is not JSON, whose top level has the wrong
type, or that `classify` cannot read -- an `enforce_admins` that is not a
boolean, a `contexts` that is not a list -- and `observe` files all three
(sd:1359). A nested value of the wrong type that can only drop a
requirement (checks, reviews, a rule) is read as absent, so it reports the
gap rather than safety; `enrich` reads bypass lists the same way.
A registered repository that has not been observed at all reads as
`unknown` as well, with `not yet observed` as its reason.

**Classic and rulesets together (sd:1430).** The rules are read whatever
classic answered. After a 404 they are the whole answer; beside a 200 they
are layered onto the classic object the way GitHub layers them: for each
merge-gating rule, the strictest source wins. The operator's decisions of
2026-09-24, which the pack's `sd_protection.combine` implements (sd:1419),
refine that. A source is *firm* for a rule when nobody can bypass it:
classic with `enforce_admins` on (and, for reviews, no bypass allowances),
or a ruleset whose `bypass_actors` was shown and is empty. The requirement
is the strictest among the firm sources; a stricter source that is not
firm is `advisory` and never tightens it (Q3). A bypass is the `bypass`
gap only when it removes a rule's last firm source; otherwise it is
`bypass_info` (Q2). Administrators are enforced on a rule when any source
imposing it binds them, and `enforce_admins` is true only when that holds
for every required rule (Q1). More than one source reads `source:
combined`, with a `sources` map per rule (Q4). One source keeps the output
it had. A rules read that fails beside a 200 keeps the classic result and
names the fault in `rules_read_error`: layering can only add requirements,
so classic alone is never reported stronger than it is.

**The fleet baseline (sd:1741).** Two more flags ride in the same
`merge_settings` list, for the repositories the operator owns
(`BASELINE_OWNERS`): `protection_source`, raised unless rulesets alone
protect the branch, and `required_check`, raised unless `ci` is among the
required contexts -- present, not sole, so `route` or `body-lint` may stand
beside it. A repository whose `repo.ci` is `local` runs no Actions, so for
it the check is `sd/local-gate`, and that is also the one context it
produces, as the pack's `sd-status` reads it (sd:1992). Like the merge flags they are not gaps an acknowledgement can
silence. A repository another owner holds carries neither, and the screen
shows the two cells as not applicable. A job that a required job gates
through `needs` in the same workflow file is covered by it, so an
aggregate's inner jobs are not `produced_not_required`. `needs` alone does
not gate: a failed need skips the job, and a skipped required check passes,
so only the aggregate `design.md` prescribes counts, exactly as written
there; it gates every need (`_gated_needs`).

**Alerts ride along (sd:2205, sd:2206).** For a managed repository the
sweep also stores, in the same row's `body.alerts`, its open Dependabot
alerts (one page, by severity; `more` when GitHub has a next page) and its
secret-scanning facts: visibility, the `security_and_analysis` setting, and,
when scanning is on in a public repository, its open alerts. The setting
comes with the repository read the basic observation already made; the
alert pages are read last, from what the observations and bypass reads
left, so they never take a repository's three. An alert read that fails is
that read's `reason`, never a count of zero. Health reads the row and calls
nothing.

**A side observation, not the tracker.** `shadow_sync.sync` calls `sync`
here after the contribution refresh and before it writes its own heartbeat.
A failure here becomes `unknown` rows and its own heartbeat; it never fails
the tracker and never holds the watermark.

    Otherwise the object is classic-shaped, marked `source: "combined"`, and
    carries per rule `sources` (`classic` or `ruleset:<id>`), `firm` (the
    ones nobody can bypass) and `admins` (whether a source binds
    administrators: `True`, `False`, or `None` for unknown). The
    requirement is the strictest among the firm sources, or among all of
    them when none is firm -- the rule whose bypass is the `bypass` gap.
    `advisory` names a stricter source that is not firm; `bypass_info` a
    bypass that is not decisive. `enforce_admins` is `True` only when every
    rule has a source binding administrators, `False` when one has none
    that could, and `None` otherwise.
