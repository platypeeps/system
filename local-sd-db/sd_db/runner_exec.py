    One copy, called from `prepare` and from `standing_refusal`, so a caller
    that skips work on the answer cannot drift from what `prepare` will
    really do, and a refusal added here is asked by both.

    These are the whole of that set: a restore still to finish, a command
    palette that cannot be read, a palette that changed since it was read, a
    command the palette does not register on this screen, a command it
    rejected from the catalog, typed values that are not the ones its entry
    declares, and a value whose type or form is wrong for the kind its entry
    declares it -- an item placeholder declared a provider, say. For a caller
    that passes `require_queue`, also an entry `prepare` would not queue: a
    worktree command that does not mutate runs at once instead, so a batch
    that only ever queues would record an exec note for a row that never
    runs (sd:814).

    Membership is not "reads nothing", and it is not "reads no item row".
    Every one of them reads the store, because the pending restore is a
    query, and all but that first one read the filesystem: the palette file,
    and the executable a worktree entry declares. What none of them does is
    read the row, or resolve one of its values against the store or the
    filesystem, so a batch that offers every row the same kind of value gets
    the same answer for each of them. "Reads no item row" would not draw
    that line at all: the four refusals in `_values` above that
    `standing_refusal` deliberately leaves out read no item row either, and
    the ones that do are `_checked_state`'s stale or missing row and
    `runner.enqueue`'s (sd:820). The scope checks below in `prepare` read
    the item too, and a supervisor or control entry reaching a caller that
    offers a worktree entry's values is refused here by `_shape` first,
    because such an entry must declare an `assignment`.

    The order is the set's, not a detail. Every refusal here precedes
    `_checked_state` in `prepare`, so a value of the wrong type or form for
    its kind is refused on the form and never on the row, and the dashboard
    sends 400 for it where a well-typed value on the same request would have
    got 409 with `reload` for a stale row, or 404 for a row that is not
    there (`local-project-dashboard/sd_dashboard/server.py:548`). Nothing
    branches on the difference -- `dashboard.js` reads `error` alone, and the
    CLI exits 1 for any of them -- so it is recorded here rather than pinned
    by a test, which is what a reader of either code would need (sd:820).

    item's revision -- asks this once and skips the setup when it answers.
    Without it a refusal that stands for a hundred nights costs a hundred
    notes and a hundred revisions on a row that was never queued: first a
    pending restore (sd:786), then a `plan-item` entry the palette registers
    on some other screen (sd:805), or one whose `item` placeholder it
    declares as some other kind, or, asked with `require_queue`, one that
    does not mutate and so would never be queued (sd:814). Enumerated once here rather than special
    cased once per trigger, because a third trigger would outlive a second
    special case.

    Every refusal that reads the item, or resolves a value against the store
    or the filesystem, is deliberately absent: a stale or missing row, a
    value of the right form that does not resolve (another item, a provider
    not enabled, another item's assignment, a destination already there), a
    row with no registered repository, and all of `runner.enqueue` -- a NULL
    branch, an assignment already open, a retained lease. Those differ row by
    row, and a batch must set the next row up and try it. Only the first of
    them and `runner.enqueue` read the item row. Another item is a
    comparison; the provider, the assignment and the destination are a
    registry read, a queue read and an `exists()` in `_values`; and the
    repository is a `repo` query on the row `_checked_state` already read.
    That is why "reads no item row" is not the line between the two sets
    (sd:820).

    The answer is read, not held: a restore that arrives or clears between
    this call and a later `prepare` leaves it stale for the rows after it, in
    both directions. Ask it as late and as near the first `prepare` as the
    caller can.
