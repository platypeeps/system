    assignment's budget or the bill's cap) is `blocked` with the ledger's
    exposure line as `detail` and the same line filed as an open `followup`
    on the item, which is requirement 6's `budget spent` note with the
    amount -- the ledger's message begins `budget spent:` for a budget.
    What `call` refuses by name (`CallRefused`, or a `LedgerRefused` about
    the call itself) is raised through unchanged; the runner ends the row
    on it as on any refusal. The response body is returned for the runner
    to write where a `start` session's output goes; nothing here touches
    a file. `retain`, when given, is called with that body before the
    ending is written, so an ending never claims a work product that was
    not kept: what `retain` raises leaves the run with no outcome, for the
    caller's handler to end it on the error, the call already settled. A
    refused reservation has no body and calls `retain` not at all.
    A cancel requested while the call was on the wire wins the ending,
    answered or refused: the `start` path polls `cancel_requested` and this
    path has no poll, so the row is re-read after the wire; the settled
    cost and the retained body stand.
