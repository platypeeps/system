"""The system dashboard's legacy views, one tab per invocation.

The framework dashboard replaced this one, and six of these views did not go
with it: Toolbox, Briefs, Vault, Research, Ports and Queues read the vault, the
launchd job table and this machine's service map, and all six stay
system-owned. So they reached that dashboard through the plugin contract
instead of being ported into it -- the collectors below are `collectors.py`'s
own, imported rather than copied, and this file is only the part that turns
them into a tab. The pack dashboard is no longer served and its plugin loader
is gone (sd:719). The workflow dashboard in `sd_dashboard/` renders the views
now: under Operations, Resources, `reports_screen.collect` runs this file as a
child for Toolbox, Briefs, Vault, Research and Queues, and the Ports area
calls `collect_ports` in-process (`ports_screen.py`).

Five when this file was written; Queues joined at 6b-6, and the count is now
`TABS` rather than a number in a sentence. A new view is a builder and its
line in that dict, plus its name and ceiling in `reports_screen.py` (`VIEWS`,
`VIEW_SECONDS`). `briefs-rows` is a tab and not a view: the Briefs page
(`sd_dashboard/briefs_screen.py`) runs it for its rows as data (sd:2112).

**One invocation per tab.** A Resources view runs `sd_tile.py <name>` once per
view, under five seconds and 64KB, as the pack's loader ran
`dashboard.sh tile <name>` for each name the manifest declared. That is not a style
choice: run behind one command these collectors took 6.66s together and
would be killed on every load, permanently. When this was written, each of them
alone fitted the budget several times over.

Ports is the tight one. `collect_ports` declares 5 seconds, and here it is read
within `TILE_SECONDS - TILE_MARGIN`, four seconds; the whole tile measured
1.72-1.96s on 2026-09-13 (sd:756). The margin is there for a caller that holds
the tile to five seconds and kills it there: the collector stops its scan and
the tile exits 1 with the reason on stderr before those five seconds run out
(sd:722). The pack's loader was that caller, and a Resources view is that
caller now -- `collectors.Budget` kills the tile's process group at
`VIEW_SECONDS`. The kill is not hypothetical: on 2026-09-14, under load, the
Vault and Research views both returned "python ran past its budget of 5
seconds" in place of the view.

What no longer reaches this tab is `within`. `reports_screen.VIEWS` has no
ports entry, so no Resources view runs the ports tile, and the Ports area calls
`collect_ports` in-process instead (`ports_screen.py`); the only caller that
still passes `within` is `dashboard.sh tile ports` from a shell, which applies
no outer limit of its own. The margin itself bounds every tab on every path
regardless -- `main` sets it as the deadline for the whole tab, not just for
Ports. The other five tabs were not re-measured then.

**Every command a tab runs stops at the same four seconds.** `main` sets that
deadline on the collectors it loads, and each nested command's own timeout is
capped at the time left (sd:760). Those commands run in sessions of their own,
which a kill of the tile's group does not reach: before this, a tab killed at
five seconds left its vault probe or `launchctl list` running with nobody to
stop it, and a TCC-held vault showed "ran past its budget" instead of the Full
Disk Access reason. Now the tile kills them itself and exits 1 with its reason.

**Markup is a table and nothing else.** A tile cannot send script: the
Resources view's filter (`SafeFragment` in `reports_screen.py`) keeps only
headings, paragraphs, tables, lists and links, an `href` only when it is
http(s), and drops every other tag and attribute. The pack loader's filter
dropped script, inline handlers and anything that fetched, and its backbone
read `data-sd-search` as a filter box, `data-sd-sort` as click-to-sort headers,
and `data-sort` on a header as how that column compares. The tables here still
carry those attributes; the Resources view drops them. Everything here is
therefore plain markup, and nothing here needs to be trusted.

**No shebang, on purpose, and two interpreters rather than one.** Two callers
run this file and they do not agree on the interpreter. A Resources view runs
it as `[sys.executable, "-I", <this file>, tab]` (`reports_screen.collect`), so
it inherits the server's own interpreter -- `SD_DASHBOARD_PYTHON`, which the
LaunchAgent sets to the command pack's `.venv/bin/python`, today Homebrew
python@3.13, execing that framework's `Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python`.
`dashboard.sh tile <tab>` runs it under `DASHBOARD_PYTHON` from `.env`, today
`/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`, which is Homebrew python@3.14 and execs a
different `Python.app` binary. A shebang would add a third, whatever `python3`
resolves to on the caller's PATH, so this file names none and lets each caller
say.

Which binary runs is not an incidental detail: the vault lives under
`~/Documents`, behind macOS Full Disk Access, and FDA is granted to a binary,
so each of those two paths needs its own grant. An ungranted interpreter does
not read an empty vault and report it as one -- `collectors.vault_blocked`
probes the read in a child first, and a refusal becomes the tile's exit 1 with
the reason, naming the interpreter to grant. The Resources path is the one this
machine exercises: on 2026-09-14 its Briefs view rendered from the launchd
server with no refusal, so the python@3.13 binary holds the grant. Whether the
python@3.14 binary does was not measured under launchd; a shell has its own
Documents access and cannot answer it. That is also why nothing reported a
grant one path lost: `vault_blocked` names the interpreter it runs under, on
the tile that was asked, and a `brew upgrade python` on the other Cellar
drops that path's grant with no tile to say so. `dashboard.sh grants` asks
the same probe of both paths and prints one line per path (`vault_grants`,
sd:831); a control listing by `/bin/ls`, which holds no grant of its own,
says whether the answers are the binaries' own or the caller's reaching its
children. A second wrapper script beside
`dashboard.sh` was the first shape and was wrong twice over -- it broke the
folder's one-entrypoint convention and it copied the resolution that script
already does.

**Silence is not an outcome.** A collector that fails must not leave a calm
tab: exceptions become the tile's own exit-1 with the reason on stderr, which
a Resources view shows in place of the view, naming this tab. The pack's loader
turned it into a rank-0 row.

# this repository has measured under launchd -- an unanswered prompt held a
# collector for 1605 seconds (`collectors.VAULT_PROBE_SECONDS`) -- so if that
# is also the shape the control takes there, reading `waited` as unmeasured
# would leave the verb no route to 0 in the one place it is meant to be run.
# Which shape launchd gives is itself unmeasured (sd:845 R3, an owner action:
# a transient job raises a TCC prompt). Measure that first; it decides this.

    """One line per interpreter path, each probed as the binary whose grant is in question.

    `named` is `ROLE=path` per interpreter, the two `dashboard.sh grants`
    passes: `DASHBOARD_PYTHON` for `tile` and `queue-open` from a shell and
    `SD_DASHBOARD_PYTHON` for the server and the tiles a Resources view runs
    as its children. macOS grants Full Disk Access per binary, and a
    `brew upgrade python` moves one Cellar path and drops that path's grant
    silently. `collectors.vault_blocked` reports that only for the interpreter
    it runs under, on the tile that was asked, so the other path's loss had
    nowhere to appear but as an empty tab (sd:831). This asks the same probe,
    `collectors.probe_vault`, of each path, and a dropped grant is a line
    naming the path and what to grant, from `collectors.vault_refusal`.

    Two paths that resolve to one binary are probed once and said to be one:
    TCC attributes the read to the binary, so one grant covers both.

    The answers are the binaries' own only when the caller's are not
    reaching them. From a Terminal, or any process with Documents access of
    its own, every child reads the vault: on 2026-09-14 the probe returned
    `ok` under every candidate including `/bin/ls`. So `/bin/ls`, which holds
    no grant of its own, is the control (`collectors.control_listing`), and it
    runs the listing the probe runs rather than a stat. Only a control that
    was kept out -- refused, or left waiting as an unanswerable prompt leaves
    a read under launchd -- lets an `ok` above it stand as that binary's own
    grant. A control that listed the vault, or that measured nothing at all,
    is a caveat line and `GRANTS_INCONCLUSIVE`: not measuring is not the same
    as measuring that the answers hold (review-376 B1). A path that cannot
    read is a refusal whatever the control says: exit 1.
