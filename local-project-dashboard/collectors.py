"""The collectors the system dashboard was built around, and nothing else.

**That dashboard is gone.** Its HTTP server, its page, its assets and its
write endpoints were deleted at 6b-8 of the artifacts-as-product rollout. What
is left is the half that reads this machine -- the vault, the launchd job
table, the research checkouts, the local-* toolbox, the service map -- because
that half is system-owned and always was. It reached the pack dashboard
through the plugin contract, one tab per invocation, until sd:719 retired that
contract. The workflow dashboard in `sd_dashboard/` reads it now, in its
Operations Resources views and its Ports area.

**Two callers, and the Ports budget belongs to neither of them.** `sd_tile.py`
imports this module for its tabs. `sd_dashboard/ports_screen.py` loads it by
path and calls `collect_ports` inside the serving process, with no tile in
between. (`sd_dashboard/reports_screen.py` runs `sd_tile.py` as a child for
five views, so it reaches the collectors through the first caller. It
loads this module by path only for `Budget`, which reads that child within the
64KB and a ceiling each view declares, sd:758.)

The plugin contract was also a budget: the pack read each tile under five
seconds and 64 KB, while reading (`dashboard/plugins.py`, `TILE_SECONDS` and
`TILE_BYTES`, all three gone from the pack since sd:719 step 3). The
Resources views keep both figures (`VIEW_SECONDS` in `reports_screen.py`, and
`Budget` below). The in-process call had neither ceiling -- it passed
`timeout=12` and returned whatever the scan printed -- so until sd:722 the
same collector was bounded for one caller and unbounded for the other.

So `collect_ports` now carries the budget itself. `Budget` below is the one
definition. The size ceiling, `BUDGET_BYTES`, is shared by every collector.
The time ceiling is declared by each collector with `budgeted`, and a caller
cannot raise it. Every command a collection runs reads through one `Budget`,
which stops the command at either ceiling while reading and raises
`OverBudget`.

Ports declares 5 seconds, the retired plugin contract's figure. It declared 15
for a day while `machine-setup.sh candidates service` ran one lsof per port and took
10.7s to 34s (sd:722); since sd:756 that scan runs one lsof and one netstat
for the whole table.

Five seconds on a whole tile process was the retired plugin contract's outer
limit. The pack's loader enforced it for every tab; a Resources view's `Budget`
enforces it now for the five tabs it runs (`reports_screen.VIEWS`,
`VIEW_SECONDS`), which hold Toolbox, Briefs, Vault, Research and Queues, and
kills the tile's process group there. Ports is not among them: no Resources
view runs the ports tile, and the Ports page calls `collect_ports` in-process.
`sd_tile.py` holds every tab a second earlier than five, so the collector
refuses, and stops its scan, before that kill arrives: a failed tab with the
reason on stderr. It does that for the tab as a whole through `set_deadline`;
`within`, which can only tighten a declaration, it passes for Ports alone, and
with the loader gone the only caller that reaches `within` is
`dashboard.sh tile ports` from a shell, which sets no outer limit of its own.
The Ports page applies the declaration as it stands and refuses visibly past it
instead of waiting. The other collectors here have no budget of their own,
because a tile is still their only way in; a second in-process caller for one
of them owes it the same treatment. On that way in, every command they run
stops at the tile's deadline (`set_deadline`, sd:760), so the tile refuses with
its reason before its caller's kill, whatever the command's own timeout.

Which dashboard that is has changed twice, so name it rather than say "the new
one": the pack's dashboard held :8767 for a week of 2026-09, and the workflow
server in `sd_dashboard/` -- this same directory -- took the port back at #221
and serves it now. A reader who arrives at this file looking for the program
that used to be here will find one next door, and it is not the one this
docstring was written against.

So this is a library now, not a program. No `main`, no port, no `Handler`, no
refresher thread, and no `if __name__ == "__main__"`: running it does nothing,
which is the honest shape for a file whose entry point is somebody else's.

**The writes went with the server, deliberately.** `update_note`, `set_ack` and
`note_path` are deleted rather than kept for later. The pack's actions were
commands and not forms, so nothing a page sent was interpolated into an argv
(R11-D25), and setting a note's status stays in Obsidian, where it already
happened and where the single-writer rules are specified. A dashboard that
could still write these notes from here would be the second writer that record
declines to become.

**What was dropped with them, and is not coming back through this file:** the
repo, work, PR, issue, Jira and rtk collectors, whose replacements were the
pack dashboard's own; the ack store; and the markdown renderer, which existed to
draw pages. Every knob still arrives as an environment variable, and with the
server went the shell that used to resolve them: `VAULT` and `REPO_ROOT` are
defaulted here, in the module that reads them, and `dashboard.sh` resolves only
the interpreter now.

**No shebang, and no `main()`.** This file is imported by `sd_tile.py`,
`sd_dashboard/ports_screen.py` and `sd_dashboard/reports_screen.py`, and run by
nothing. It had both while it was a program.

# process with `timeout=12` and no size ceiling at all (sd:722).
#
# The size ceiling is one number for every collector: 64KB of command output,
# the plugin contract's per-tile figure (`TILE_BYTES` in the pack's
# `dashboard/plugins.py`, which sd:719 step 3 deleted), copied rather than
# imported because this repository does not import the pack. The time ceiling is each collector's own, declared with

# questions of it. The ports scan asks only whether there was any. A Resources
# view (`reports_screen.collect`) shows it as the view's reason, and there the
# tail is one line, `sd_tile.main`'s `<tab>: <error>`, whose tab name is at the
# FRONT. A cap the line outgrows therefore drops the name first: at 512 bytes,
# a checkout under a 136-character HOME lost exactly `vault` from the Full Disk
# Access refusal and turned a green suite red with a message that named
# nothing (sd:830). That line embeds two paths, the vault's and the
# interpreter's, each at most PATH_MAX (1024 bytes on macOS), inside about 200
# bytes of prose, so 4 KB holds the longest one the tile was known to write.
# Known to, not could: an error of any other length was still the tile's to
# write, and one past the cap lost the name the same way (sd:834). So the
# tile bounds the line itself, to this many bytes (`sd_tile.ERROR_BYTES`,
# pinned to this value by `tests/test_stderr_cap.py`), and what a chatty
# child printed before it is all a cut here can drop. When a cut does
# happen, `Budget.run` says so at the front of what it kept, naming the tab

    The control has to run the operation the probe runs -- a listing. `ls -d`
    stats, and TCC gates the listing and not the stat: `/bin/ls -d` prints the
    name of a directory the same `/bin/ls` cannot list, so a stat as the
    control passes on every existing path and measures only that it exists
    (review-376 B1, measured on ~/Library/Safari).

    Four answers, not two, because `run` above returns '' for a command that
    was refused and for one that never ran alike, and a control that cannot
    tell those apart turns its own failure into a conclusive pass. So this
    keeps the exit status and the reason:

    - `listed`, exit zero: the caller's own access reached this binary, which
      holds no grant of its own.
    - `refused`: the failure named itself on stderr, the way an access failure
      does and a missing directory or a broken `ls` does not.
    - `waited`: nothing at all for the whole timeout. That is what an
      ungranted read looks like where nobody can answer the prompt -- the
      reason `VAULT_PROBE` reads its own silence as `denied` -- so it is a
      refusal that says how it refused rather than a failure to measure.
    - '': anything else. The control measured nothing, which is a state its
      caller has to carry rather than round off to either answer.

    The child is in a session of its own and the whole group is killed at the
    timeout, for the reason `run` above gives: a grandchild holding the pipe
    would otherwise keep the read open past it.

    It runs under `LC_ALL=C`, because `refused` is read off the words on
    stderr and those words are a locale's (sd:845). Darwin does not localise
    them today -- its `LC_MESSAGES` catalogues hold the yes/no expressions and
    no `strerror` at all, so `/bin/ls` says `Permission denied` under
    `fr_FR.UTF-8` as it does under `C`, measured 2026-09-14 -- so this pins a
    platform property rather than fixing a live bug. Worth pinning anyway: it
    costs one word, it is the only assumption in the classifier that the code
    could not state for itself, and the answer it would otherwise fall to is
    '', which is inconclusive and never a false pass.

    for a number the nightly job at 03:30 already computed and wrote to this
    log verbatim. Reading it costs a millisecond.

    What the swap gives up is freshness, so freshness is reported rather than
    implied: `drift_at` is the run that produced the numbers and `drift_age_h`
    is its age. `drift_unknown` says why the current drift is not known --
    which covers both having no number and having one that cannot be trusted,

    longer exists as much as a missing one does. A missing log and a clean
    machine both rendered as an em-dash before, and those are not the same
    fact either. `drift_logged` is false only when no log exists at all,
    which is the one case that means never rather than merely unknown.

    The job appends, so only the final run block counts. A block with no
    `drift :` line is unknown rather than zero, and which kind of unknown

    Neither command line takes an argument from a caller.

    Part of the Ports collection, so a call without a runner reads inside a
    budget of Ports' declaration; `collect_ports` hands it the one it is
    spending.

    The same two rules the machine-setup port probe follows (sd:756).
    `-w` silences lsof's warnings, such as this machine's "can't stat() apfs
    file system" line for a Carbon Copy Cloner snapshot mount, which concern
    naming files and not the socket table; whatever still reaches stderr is an
    error. And lsof run as this user leaves out root's listeners without saying
    so, so netstat's LISTEN ports are read too: one that lsof did not name, or a
    netstat table that was not read, means the inventory is not complete. The
    ports lsof did name stay visible either way. The comparison is by port,
    not by socket: a root listener on another address of a port lsof names
    leaves the inventory complete with that port's holders partial (review-330
    N3). The shell function is not called from here because it keeps one
