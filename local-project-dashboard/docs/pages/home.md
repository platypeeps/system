# Home

Home is at `/home` (sd:2117): the design's critical Home Assistant tiles and
its wall display (`?kiosk=1`). `GET /api/home` (`home_screen.document`) lists
the tiles one text names, one `headline|<entity_id>|<name>` or
`tile|<group>|<entity_id>|<name>` per line. An optional last field, `alarm`,
`lock`, `toggle` or `sensor`, sets how the tile reads its state when its domain
would not; its commands follow the domain. Entity ids describe a house, so the checkout ships only
`home-tiles.conf.example`. A line the page cannot read is named and skipped;
with no list the page says "No tile list" and draws no grid.

The text is the workflow database's setting row `dashboard.home_tiles`
(sd:3987). The row wins: once it exists, `<config>/project-dashboard/home-tiles.conf`
is not read; with no row the file answers. A failed row read says "tile list
not read" with its reason, reads no file in its place and calls Home
Assistant for nothing. Edit tiles opens a text editor on the row, else the
file, else the example. Save posts `POST /api/home/tiles {text, before}`:
it parses first and refuses a text with problems (400, each with its line
number), and refuses a `before` that is not the digest of the text the page
showed (409, nothing written). A save toasts with Undo, which posts the
previous text. The first Save is the import; the lead deletes the file after
one nightly cycle. Each read makes one `GET /api/states` call to Home Assistant (sd:3427),
bounded by `home_screen.TIMEOUT`, with the URL and token local-ha-mcp uses:
`HA_MCP_URL` and `HA_TOKEN` from the environment, else `<config>/ha-mcp/.env`.
The LaunchAgent does not carry `HA_TOKEN`, so the server reads that file. Each
tile shows its state in the design's grammar and its age from `last_changed`.
A failed read (not configured, down, token refused, timed out, redirected, an
answer it cannot parse) names its error on every tile, and an entity Home
Assistant does not list names its own; the page still draws. The token never
reaches the page, and no redirect is followed. Under launchd the server's
interpreter may need macOS Local Network permission to reach a LAN host, as
local-ha-mcp's Node does.

A tile's Act section and row menu offer the Home Assistant services its domain
allows (sd:4966), from `home_screen.SERVICES`, which the document carries as
`writes.services`: light, switch, fan and input_boolean turn on, off or toggle
at once with Undo; scene and script turn on and button presses, once, with no
Undo; lock (lock, unlock), alarm_control_panel (arm home, away or night,
disarm) and cover (open, close) change physical security, so each asks for the
entity id typed out and has no Undo. Each posts `POST /api/home/service
{entity_id, service, before[, confirm]}`, which refuses (400, nothing sent) an
entity the tile list does not name, a service the allowlist does not name for
that domain, and a security service whose `confirm` is not the entity id; a
`before` that is not the tile list's digest is a 409. It then calls
`POST /api/services/<domain>/<service>` with the read's URL and token, bounded
by `home_screen.SERVICE_TIMEOUT`, writes one record to the command journal
(Activity's "Command journal", on the Home page's item), and reads the tile's
state again, which the tile shows at once. Home Assistant's own reason for a
refusal (a token without service rights is a 401 or 403) is the toast; no
answer is an unknown outcome, and the page reads the tiles again. Writes are
off, with the read's reason, until Home Assistant was read. Any other domain
gets Read state, copy only: its `curl` line names `$HA_TOKEN` and `$HA_URL`
and never holds a value. The page reads `/api/home` through the
shell's reader (`read.js`) when it opens, on Read again, and each minute while
it is visible (sd:3522); the minute read draws no loading state, so the tiles
keep their place, and a failed read draws no tile and says why.

A binary sensor reads by its `device_class` (sd:4959): on is ok for
connectivity, power, plug, running, battery charging and presence, and off is
neutral except connectivity, which reads caution; on is a warning
for problem, smoke, gas, carbon monoxide, moisture, safety, tamper, heat and
cold; and a neutral fact, with no colour, for doors, windows, openings, motion
and occupancy. A sensor with no class is neutral on/off. Details opens with one
line on what the state means, from the same device class and domain tables, and
names the entity, its last change and its source. The repo holds no text per
entity.

A script or automation tile reads as its last run (sd:5727): Home Assistant's
`last_triggered`, in local time with its zone, or "last run not read" when the
answer holds none. Good night is such a tile; its entity id is in the tile list.

Views (`places.js`, `places.py`): Overview is the page above; Tasks, Briefs and
Reports each read their own document, `GET /api/home/tasks`, `/briefs` and
`/reports`, only when shown, and the address keeps the view as `#view=<id>`.
Tasks are the open items with no repo: personal and home items have none; Tasks under Realm Home holds the same rows. A report is in no Tasks realm. A brief is home's when its series, lower-cased with spaces as hyphens,
names a job of the `home` family in `dashboard.report_families`; a report
is home's when its job is in that family. A missing checkout, family or file
makes the view unknown with the reason and the line to add, never an empty list.
The views are `window.PAGE_VIEWS`, set from the markup before `shell.js`; the shell's view switch draws
them in `#viewswitch`, and until that shell lands `places.js` draws a segmented control there (`viewSwitch`).
