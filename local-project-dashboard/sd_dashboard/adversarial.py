"""Adversarial review (sd:5064): one click runs `local-adversarial-gate` on a task, a brief, a repository or a change.

The operator asked on 2026-10-18 (a note on sd:5064) for a hostile second read by another model than the one that
wrote the work: codex, at the model and effort the `adversarial.model` and `adversarial.effort` setting rows hold
(sd:5109; Settings edits them), else `MODEL` at `EFFORT`. A page posts `/api/adversarial` with `{"kind", "target"}`:

  task    an item id. The item's repository is the checkout; an item without one is refused, as Fix refuses it.
  brief   the id of a routine brief (kind `report`, source `brief`). Its repository, else this checkout.
  repo    a registered repository, by its key or its path.
  change  a checkout directory, a worktree or a clone of a registered repository. Optional: `base`, the ref it is
          compared with (default `origin/HEAD`, then `origin/main`, then `main`); `item`, the item it belongs to; and
          `body`, the file holding its pull-request body. With `pr`, a number (sd:5100), the target is a registered
          repository and the change is that open pull request: it must be open in that repository's GitHub slug as
          `sd shadow sync` last saw it, and its head is `refs/pull/<pr>/head` as `git ls-remote origin` names it. The
          head commit must already be in the checkout: the dashboard fetches nothing, and a refusal names the fetch.
  deep    a registered repository, reviewed by headless claude rather than codex (sd:5100): `lenses/deep.md` has the
          lead fan out read-only sub-agents, one per area, then verify and rank what they find. Its model, effort,
          bound and sub-agent cap are the `DEEP` setting rows in the workflow database (sd:5109), else their defaults;
          `save_settings` writes them. Its lock is the repository's own, so one deep review runs per repository.
  source  a research checkout's key, as the Research page lists it, with `source`, one ledger row's key: its URL or
          `id:<ID>` (sd:5101). The checkout must be registered. The input holds the row and the claims citing it, as
          the page's own reader finds them; the runner appends the row's link as it fetched it, one bounded GET
          (`_fetch`), so codex's sandbox needs no network. The brief names the row's key in its front matter, which is
          how `source_reviews` finds a row's reviews: a re-run files a brief of its own, and a ledger edit that keeps
          the key keeps them.

`start` runs in the POST, in four steps, and answers 202 at once:

1. The target, resolved to a checkout, its registered repository and the lens's inputs; then the settings.
2. The lock, taken without waiting: `<state>/lock` for a codex review, `<state>/deep-<checkout hash>.lock` for a deep
   one. A second run while one holds it is a 409 naming the run.
3. The run's state file, `<state>/runs/<id>.json`, as `queued`, with the item's or the change's text beside it as
   `<id>.input.md`. Codex writes its result beside them as `<id>.md`.
4. This file as a script, in a session of its own, holding the lock's descriptor: the lock is released only when
   the runner and every process under it have exited, so nothing runs codex beside it, and no second deep review
   reads the same repository.

The runner (`run`) marks the run `running`, runs `adversarial-gate.sh run` (`deep` for a deep review), bounded by
the gate at the run's timeout (exit 124) and here at that timeout plus `GRACE`, and marks it `done` or `failed` with the reason. It then files the outcome in the
database the server reads, in one transaction, as the operator asked in note #22943 on sd:5064:

- Each titled hypothesis is a recommendation: one Approve-or-Reject question in a review batch (`sd_db.review`,
  queue `QUEUE`). An approval files a task in the batch's repository, titled with the question's first line
  (sd:4924), so the runner files one batch per repository the recommendations name.
- A routine brief (`sd_db.routine_briefs`) holds the target, the model and effort, the verdict and the numbered
  recommendations, each naming its batch. Each batch header's `Source:` names the brief's stem.
- When the target is an item (a task, a brief, or the change's `item`), a `comment` note names the brief and the
  batches, or the failure. A failed run files no brief and no batch.

Nothing here approves, merges, publishes or posts anywhere else; the operator picks recommendations on the Review page.

`status` answers `GET /api/adversarial/<id>` from the state file. A run whose runner is gone without an outcome reads
`failed`, with the reason, and a run queued for longer than `STARTUP` that never started reads `failed` too. A run
whose runner is gone after its outcome but before it recorded the filing reads `filed` as not known.

The runner is this file run by path. It imports `sd_db` from the folder the server loaded it from and opens the
database file the server's connection reads; the state file names both.
