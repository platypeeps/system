"""Review (sd:3709): the labelling queue's page, one row per question (design docs/work/2026-10-12-review-queue).

A batch is a task filed under `review:<queue>:<batch>` by `sd-db review file`; its questions are question notes and a
label is the Decisions ruling. Every read and write here is `sd_db.review`'s, the code `sd-db review` runs, so the page
and the CLI verb share one path (operator ruling Q3); the page adds no store and no second writer.

- `document` is `/api/review`: each open batch, nightly suggestions first and then by age, with the revision read
  before the batch, so a change between the two makes the page stale (409), never newer than what it shows; each open
  question; and in `reviewed` each ruled or expired one, with `label` and `ruling`. A blind or sealed batch sends the
  question text, options and label only: no subject and no evidence.
  A batch whose notes do not read as one is listed with its reason, never dropped.
  Each batch sends its `context` (purpose, rubric, feeds; None when filed with none), and a question its `recommendation`
  (option and reason) when it has one (sd:5759, pack sd:5763). A blind or sealed batch sends a recommendation only on a
  question its standing label ruled, with `agreed`: an open or expired question never carries it, so its label stays
  independent. A pack without the fields sends neither.
- `rule_request` is `/api/review/rule`: `review.rule`, under the batch revision the page read. Its reply names the
  question's recommendation and whether the label agreed (both None when it has none), now that the label is in.
- `withdraw_request` is `/api/review/withdraw`: `review.withdraw`, the undo.
- `recommendations` is `/api/briefs/<item>/recommendations` (sd:5064): the questions of each batch an adversarial review's
  brief names in its frontmatter (`batches: sd:N, ...`), ruled and open, with each batch's revision, so the Briefs page
  can rule the chosen ones Approve through `/api/review/rule`. A repository is sent by name, never by its local path.
- `export` is `/api/review/<item>/export`: `review.export` without a key, the lines `sd-db review export` writes.
  A blind or sealed batch exports only once no question is open, so the page never shows a subject while labelling.
