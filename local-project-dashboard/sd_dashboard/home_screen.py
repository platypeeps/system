"""Home: the tiles behind the default UI's Home page (sd:2117).

The page is `v2/home.html`; it holds no tiles. It reads one JSON document,
`/api/home`, built here by `document`.

**Which tiles.** The design names the critical Home Assistant entities one
home has: alarm panels, locks, leak and smoke sensors. Those names describe
the operator's house, and this repository is public, so they live outside the
checkout (`home-tiles.conf.example` is the template), one line per tile:

    headline|<entity_id>|<name>[|<type>]          the lamp above the groups (the problems sensor)
    tile|<group>|<entity_id>|<name>[|<type>]      a tile, in its group, in file order

`<type>` is optional: `alarm`, `lock`, `toggle` or `sensor`, how the tile
reads its state. Without it the page types the tile by its domain; a virtual
binary sensor that works as a switch needs `toggle` said. Its commands follow
the domain alone (`SERVICES`).

A line this module cannot read is named in `config.problems` with its line
number and skipped; the other lines still count.

**Where the list lives (sd:3987).** The workflow database's setting row
`dashboard.home_tiles` (`KEY`) holds the text. Row wins: once the row exists,
`<config>/project-dashboard/home-tiles.conf` is not read; with no row it
answers as before. A row read that fails is unknown: the page says "tile list
not read", reads no file in its place and calls Home Assistant for nothing.
Home's "Edit tiles" opens on the row, else the file, else the example, and
`save` writes the row: it parses first (400, each problem with its line) and
refuses a `before` that is not the digest of the text the page showed (409).
The rows keep history, so Undo posts the previous text.

**Live state (sd:3427).** Each document makes one `GET /api/states` call to
Home Assistant, bounded by `TIMEOUT`, with the URL and token local-ha-mcp
uses: `HA_MCP_URL` and `HA_TOKEN` from the environment, else from
`<config>/ha-mcp/.env`, the environment winning as in `ha-mcp.sh`. The REST
base is that URL's scheme and host. Each tile gets `state` (its value, last
change, device class and unit) or `error`, a short name for why it has none.
A script or automation tile also gets `ran`, its last run: Home Assistant's
`last_triggered`, or None when the answer holds none (sd:5727).
A failed read leaves `reader.available` false with `reader.reason`, and every
tile carries the short error; an entity the answer does not list is
`NOT_LISTED` on its tile alone. The token goes only into the request header:
no document, error or log line holds it, nor the host. No proxy is used and
no redirect is followed, so the token goes to that host alone.

**Service calls (sd:4966).** `POST /api/home/service {entity_id, service, before}` (`service`) calls one
Home Assistant service on one tile, `POST /api/services/<domain>/<service>` with the read's base and token, bounded
by `SERVICE_TIMEOUT`. It refuses (400, nothing sent) an entity the tile list does not name, a service `SERVICES` does
not allow for the entity's domain; a lock, alarm or cover service runs with no typed confirm (sd:5479); a `before`
that is not the digest of the tile text the page showed is a 409. Each call is one record in the command journal
(`runner_exec.execution_journal`, Activity's "Command journal"), on the Home page's item `JOURNAL_ITEM`: the output
file is made, with the dispatch line, before the request leaves, and the note is written with the outcome after it,
so a stop between the two leaves the file, never a note that waits for a reconcile no palette request can finish.
Home Assistant's own reason for a refusal (401, 403, 400) reaches the page. Then the tile's state is read again with
`GET /api/states/<entity_id>`. `writes.available` is true once the read worked; `writes.services` is `SERVICES`.
