"""Shared upload (sd:5405): the shared bucket's console link, the current upload link and Regenerate, on Management.

local-shared-upload (sd:5346) owns the bucket and the signer; this module loads its `shared_upload.py` by path
(`_tool`) and signs nothing itself.

- **Config.** `<config>/shared-upload/.env`, read with `system_tools_config` as `st_source_env` reads it: an exported
  value wins, an empty one too; a `change-me` value is unset, as Home reads ha-mcp's. With the bucket, region or
  profile unset the section says "not set up" and names the file; a file that does not read is the source's reason.
- **The link.** One presigned POST under `PREFIX`, for `LIFETIME` (168 h, the Signature Version 4 limit), each file up
  to `SHARED_UPLOAD_MAX_MB` (500). It is the workflow database setting row `KEY`: Regenerate writes a new row and the
  latest is the current link. A link already handed out keeps working until its expiry; nothing here revokes one.
- **Its subject.** The row names the bucket, region and prefix it was signed for; a row signed for another one is not
  the current link (`other`), and a row that does not read is unknown (`unread`), never "none signed".
- **The secret.** A link grants uploads. It goes into the setting row and the page's document only: no error, toast or
  log line holds it, and `regenerate` answers the expiry, not the link.
