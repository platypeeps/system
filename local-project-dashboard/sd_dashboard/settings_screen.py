"""Settings' Fleet section (sd:3989): the `sd.*` keys whose one value serves every machine.

The pack keeps them as setting rows in the workflow database (`sd_lib.FLEET_KEYS`). This page reads them with
`sd config list sd --json` and writes one with `sd config set sd.<key> <value>`: the pack holds each key's pattern,
description and the row-wins rule, so none is copied here. Each row shows its value, its source (`database`, `file`
or `default`) and its description; a key whose pattern is a list of words gets a select.

A failed list is named and lists nothing. A refused set answers sd's reason (400). A set that runs past `SD_SECONDS`
may have committed before it was stopped, so its outcome is unknown: it answers 504 with `unknown`, and the page reads
the value again. There is no stale-write check: two concurrent manual writes are outside the threat model, and the
answer carries the value the set replaced, so the page can say when it differs from the one it showed.

The Sweeps section (sd:5109) holds the Work and Personal sweeps' settings, `realm_sweep.SETTINGS`, and the Dashboard
section the adversarial review's model and effort (`adversarial.SETTINGS`) and the dashboard lists (`setting_rows.LISTS`):
setting rows read and written on the page's own connection (`sd_db.writes`), as no `sd config` prefix declares them.

- A single value posts `/api/settings/row {key, value, before}`: `before` is the row value the page showed, a row that
  changed since refuses with 409, and an empty value unsets.
- A list posts `/api/settings/list {key, text, before}`, as Home's tiles do (sd:3987): `before` is the digest of the
  source and text the page showed (`setting_rows.digest`). The text must parse with the list's own grammar (400, each
  problem named). The write reads the source and text again and refuses a digest that differs (409): a clear or an
  edit of the old file since the read changes it. `set_setting` then checks the row in its own transaction. An empty
  text writes a cleared row, so the old file is not read again.
