"""Queue (sd:2585): each repository's `sd-ship lane` queue, one row per item in one of six states, and its reorder.

Reads, per request: `sd-ship -C <repo> lane list` for each managed repository, `READERS` at a time, the builder gate
logs (`gate-*.log`) in its lane folder, `sd gate status --json` for the gate slots, and `os.getloadavg()` (macOS
`vm.loadavg`). The queue lives in the hub database (pack sd:3282), so a lane hosted on another machine has entries but
no folder here; every managed repository gets its section (sd:3284). The pack owns the lane root; one `lane list`
names it, as its `queue` path `<root>/<repo>/lane/queue/queue.json`, so this file repeats no rule for where lanes live.

The six states, from each entry's `status`:

  merging   `running`: its holder's host, its `step` and claim age (since `started_at`), and its lease's end, each as
            `lane list` prints it; a field an earlier pack did not write reads as not recorded, never guessed. A lease
            that ended lights caution: the holder may be stuck, and only a reclaim or a release ends it. Its `claim`,
            `<holder token>:<step>`, is what Release sends back; an entry without a token or step has none.
  next      `pending`, in queue order; a `held` one keeps its place and the runner skips it.
  building  a builder gate log in the lane folder, changed in the last `BUILDING_HOURS`: empty while its gate runs.
  blocked   the newest entry of an item that `failed`, was `skipped` or stopped `prepared`, in the last `BLOCKED_DAYS`,
            with the first line of its reason.
  cancelled the newest entry of an item that was `cancelled`, in the last `BLOCKED_DAYS`, with its head.
  landed    `merged` today, in this machine's zone, with the merge commit and the pull request its subject names.

An item's newest entry is the one with the highest `enqueue_seq`, not the last one listed: `lane move` can list a newer
entry above older ones (sd:3419). `newest` is the one place that picks it.

Writes: `move` runs `sd-ship -C <repo> lane move|hold|release|cancel|retry`, the queue's only writers. It compares the
page's revision (a digest of the pending order, the holds and each blocked or cancelled entry's head) with a fresh `lane list` first
and refuses a stale one. `move`, `hold`, `release` and `cancel` then pass the fresh list's lane revision (the pending
order and holds, the one `lane list` prints) as `--expected-revision`, and the verb checks it again under the queue's
lock, so a write that lands between the two checks is refused too. `cancel` needs it most: it also releases a running
entry (pack sd:3282), so a Cancel on a pending row the runner claimed since must not reach it.
The runner reads the queue again at each item boundary, so an edit takes effect there.
A refusal the verb reports as written-nothing (`refused`) answers 400, or 409 when stale; any other failure answers 502
with `outcome: unknown` (sd:3339). A hub fault, a timeout or an exit without a refusal may come after the write landed,
so the page reads the lane again and never says the queue is unchanged.

Retry and Approve act on a blocked row (sd:3012): `lane retry <item>` queues its last entry again at the same head with
the body copy the lane kept (pack sd:3254); Approve adds `--manual`, the merge grant, so only a repo whose
`runner_merge` is manual takes it. Both carry the head the row showed as `--expected-head`, which the verb checks under
the queue's lock (pack sd:3268), so neither acts on an entry that ended at another head after the page read it. The
page offers both only when `sd-ship lane retry --help` names `--expected-head`: an older pack cannot check the head.

Re-queue acts on a cancelled row (sd:3398): `lane retry <item> --expected-head <head>` queues the cancelled entry
again, last, at the head the row showed (pack sd:3389). The page checks first that the item's newest entry is still that
cancelled one, so it re-queues a cancel and enqueues nothing else (operator ruling, 2026-10-11). The verb refuses a
moved branch (`head_moved`), a newer entry (`superseded`) and a merged head (`already_merged`), each writing nothing.
The page offers Re-queue only when `lane retry --help` names a cancelled entry; otherwise the row says why it is off,
and a probe that failed says so, since that is not an answer.

Release acts on a running row (sd:3337, D3 of pack sd:3174): `lane cancel <item> --expected-claim <claim>` releases the
claim the row showed, in the verb's transaction (pack sd:3330). At prepare the entry goes back to pending; at merge it
fails, since a merge may have landed. A token is made per claim, so a step that moved on, a claim taken again at the same
revision and an entry that finished are each refused as `stale_claim`, which the page reads as a 409. The holder token
reaches the page for this; the pending order is not what Release acts on, so it passes no `--expected-revision`.
