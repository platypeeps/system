"""The Disk and Branches readers behind Health (sd:2202, sd:2204).

Both read this machine at request time and write nothing, as the other
Health readers do. Each runs inside one overall budget: a command that would
end past it is stopped, and the reader raises `reads.OverBudget`, which Health shows as the
area stopped rather than waited on. A partial walk is not the answer.

**Branches** (sd:2204) is the design's "merged but not deleted": the local
branches of each registered repository that `origin/HEAD` already contains,
`git for-each-ref --merged=refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/heads/`. The default
branch itself is left out. A merged branch checked out in a worktree is its
own list, because `git branch -d` refuses it. A repository with no
`origin/HEAD`, or one git cannot read, is named rather than read as clean.

**Merged worktrees** (sd:5105) are part of the Branches reading: a registered repository's linked worktree whose
`HEAD` is the head a lane entry merged from that worktree (`head`, or an older entry's `expected_head`). The lane
squash-merges, so `origin/HEAD` does not contain that head, and a fresh worktree at `origin/HEAD` is no evidence
of a merge: only the lane entry ties the tree to a merge. Each tree carries why it stays, or nothing when it can
go: a process with its working folder inside (one `lsof -a -d cwd -Fn`), uncommitted or untracked files, ignored
files other than build output and tool caches, or a branch other than the one the lane merged. A probe that gave
no answer is a reason to stay, never a pass.

**Disk** (sd:2202) is the design's "where the space went", in three parts:

- volume use from `df -kPl`, local file systems only, so a network mount
  that does not answer cannot hold the page: the data volume (`/` where
  there is no `/System/Volumes/Data`) and every volume under `/Volumes`;
- the folder sizes under each `storage|<path>` line of the
  `dashboard.disk_storage` setting row (sd:5109; `disk.conf` answers only
  while the database has never held the row), one `du -k -d 1` per folder
  with what is left of the budget; a folder `du` could not finish is a row
  that says so, not a refusal of the area;
- registered worktrees whose `HEAD` is in `origin/HEAD` and that still hold
  `target/`, `node_modules/` or `.venv/` (the 2026-09-25 rule: delete build
  output once the PR merges). Presence only: sizing build output needs a
  `du` of every tree, which the budget does not hold. Each such tree carries
  its `git status --porcelain`: only a clean one is offered for removal.

**Doctor** (sd:3393) is `machine-setup.sh doctor`, run as a child under the
collectors' `Budget`, which kills its whole process group at the deadline.
Its `ok`, `WARN`, `FAIL` and `--` lines are parsed as they are printed; an
exit or a last line the doctor does not end with is the area's error, so a
run that failed or was stopped never reads as clean.

**Revisions.** Each subject a cleanup acts on has a digest, `revision`, of
what the page showed: a checkout's registrations whose directory is gone,
a repository's merged branches and their tips, and the merged worktrees
with build output, each with its head and status. `health_cleanup` reads
the subject again at the write and refuses a digest that changed.
