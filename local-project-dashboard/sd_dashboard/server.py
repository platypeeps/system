"""The server: explicit listeners and an authentication policy on every response.

Task controls use an expiring browser session bound to its origin and verified
operator. Remote requests require the explicitly configured private Tailscale
Serve boundary to be revalidated on every request; headers cannot select it.

* **Every** response carries
  `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';
  object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors
  'none'` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` -- error pages, the 404, the stylesheet
  and the JavaScript file included. It is set in one place, `end_headers`, so
  a route added later cannot forget it.
* **No page may be framed**, which is the last directive above and the older
  header beside it. That is not a content rule: it is what stops a page on
  another origin of the same tailnet site from putting an overlay over a real
  control (`prd.md:706-716`).
* The primary socket binds loopback for Tailscale Serve. Optional direct IP
  access binds one validated Tailscale address and authenticates its socket peer.

Connections come from `sd_db.connect`: reads open `write=False`, actions open
a writer only after the request and finite action vocabulary are validated.
