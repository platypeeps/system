"""Health: the rows behind the default UI's Health page (sd:2115).

The page is `v2/health.html`; it holds no rows. It reads `summary`, every
area's lamp and the rail badge without waiting on a walker, and `part`, the
areas of one of `VIEWS`, each its own request, so a slow or failing view holds
up and takes down no other. `document` is every area at once, `/api/health`.
Each is built here from the readers the dashboard already has, so the port
adds no collector:

- Worktrees: `fleet.collect("sessions")`, the child Operations > Sessions and
  Today's Now read. A registration whose directory is gone is a row per
  checkout, carrying the registrations behind it; one whose files could not
  be read is a row of its own, in the unknown state.
- Ports: `ports_screen.port_rows` over `collect_ports`, Operations > Ports'
  reader, with its counts and warnings; collected for the request.
- Protection: `protection.rows`, what the nightly `sd shadow sync` left in
  `repo_protection`, with `protection_screen`'s rule: a repository whose
  protection was not read is unknown and shows no cell.
- Disk and Branches: `health_collectors.disk_scan` and `branch_scan`
  (sd:2202, sd:2204), each inside its own budget; that module says what
  each reads and leaves out.
- Dependencies and Security (sd:2205, sd:2206): the same `protection.rows`,
  each managed repository's `alerts`, which the nightly sync stores beside
  its protection. Health makes no GitHub call.
- Credentials (sd:2203): the latest `credentials:nightly` heartbeat that
  `sd-db credentials` writes each night: presence, validity and expiry,
  never a value. Expiry is judged against the request's time.
- Services (sd:3707): `sd_db.services.inventory`, what `sd services list`
  and Operations > Services read, cut to the long-running user LaunchAgents.
  Restart and Start post `/api/services/<label>/<action>`, the route
  Operations posts, into `sd services restart|start`'s code with the row's
  revision. The dashboard's own row adds `runtime.served_behind`, the check
  `dashboard.sh health` makes (sd:3528); its service is protected, so the row
  offers the kickstart line to copy.
- Doctor (sd:3393): `health_collectors.doctor_scan`, `machine-setup.sh
  doctor` in a child under its own deadline. Its answer is kept for
  `DOCTOR_FRESH_SECONDS`, since the doctor runs `brew doctor`; the page waits
  at most `DOCTOR_WAIT_SECONDS` for a run, and a run still going, stopped or
  failed is the area's error, never a clean lamp.

The design source shows nine areas; the page leaves out its Attribution
(sd:3011). The parts no reader covers are in the
document as `missing`, by name, so
the page says what it does not read instead of showing a clean lamp. A
reader that fails is its area's `error`, never an empty area: a fleet
nobody could read must not look like a fleet with nothing wrong.

Nothing here writes. Prune, Delete merged and Remove build output post
`/api/health/cleanup` (`health_cleanup`) with the row's `revision`, which
`health_collectors` computes the same way the write does.

    """Every area of the design, each with its rows, the reason it was not read, and what no reader covers.

    `fleet` is `fleet.collect`'s shape, `area -> document`, `ports`
    `collect_ports`' (no argument) and
    `protection` `protection.rows`', and `disk` and `branches`
    `health_collectors.disk_scan`'s and `branch_scan`'s, and `credentials`
    `read_credentials`', and `services` the service backend `read_services` hands
    `sd_db.services` (`served_commit` is the commit this process started on); each is a seam a test fills. Each reader
    is guarded on its own, so one failure is its area's `error` and the
    others still answer. A reader returns its rows, or its rows and what the
    page draws above them (`extra`). `view`, one of `VIEWS`, reads only that
    view's areas (`part`); none reads them all, for `/api/health`.

    **The walkers run at once.** Each waits on subprocesses inside its own
    budget, so in series the budgets add up (Disk's and Branches' 8, the
    fleet's 12) and at once the slowest decides.
    A sqlite connection belongs to the thread that opened it, so the
    registry the default walkers need is read here first and handed to them
    as paths; Protection, which reads only the database, stays on this
    thread. `PAGE_SECONDS` bounds the whole document: a reader still running
    at it is left to stop at its own budget, not waited on. While it runs, a
    later request starts no second scan of that area (`_Scans`); the area
    shows its last answer marked `stale`, or is its error if it has none.
    A row the operator snoozed (sd:1896) is in its area's `snoozed`, with its
    `until`, and not in `rows`; `snooze_error` says why none could be read.
    Each area as settled, before the snooze split, is kept for `summary`.
