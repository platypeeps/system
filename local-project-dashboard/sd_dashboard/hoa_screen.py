"""HOA: the water system behind the default UI's HOA page (sd:2116).

The page is `v2/hoa.html`; it holds no data. It reads one JSON document,
`/api/hoa`, built here by `document`.

**Where the data is.** The design reads one HOA checkout: the asset map
(`water/map/assets.geojson`, `water/map/base.geojson`), the Mission telemetry
export (`water/metrics/mission/*.csv`), the lot data the checkout's
`tools/fetch-lot-parcels.py` writes to its gitignored `downloads/parcels/lots.json`
(each lot's address and owner of record, sd:4964) and the checkout's open items of
every kind but report. The checkout is the one repo in the workflow database's repo table
whose folder is named `hoa` (sd:3985), so no config file holds its path. A
second repo with that folder name is an error that names both, never a guess.

**Each source is guarded on its own.** A file that is missing or does not
parse is that part's `error`; the other parts still answer, and the page shows
the failed part as unknown with the reason, never as an empty list. The read
reaches no network: the map draws the vectors in the files, and the page loads
no tiles. It runs one command, the checkout's bounded `tools/source-ages.py`,
and reads the refresh jobs' launchd state, and asks the checkout's `tools/sweep.py status --json` for the last sweep
(`sweep`); it starts nothing. The writes are Acknowledge (`acknowledge`), the jobs route Refresh now posts, and
Run sweep (`sweep.start`).
