"""The execution journal's dashboard writer (sd:5541): one `exec` note for each command a page runs.

Activity's Commands lamp reads the execution journal, `runner_exec.execution_journal`. Its two writers retired: the v1
palette (`runner_exec.prepare`) and the old runner (`runner.release`). The pages' buttons that start a process or call
out (Run now, Publish now, Build deck, Import to Slides, Run sweep, ...) go through one place, the server's POST, and
`COMMANDS` names them. A route that only writes the database (hide, acknowledge, a note, a setting) is no command; nor
is a chat question, which runs nothing, or a Home Assistant call, which `home_screen` already journals itself.

The record is the palette's shape, so Activity and `/api/executions/<note>` read it with no second reader: `version` 1,
`note` its own id, `command` the button's label and target, `scope` `dashboard`, and `output_path` a
`<database folder>/executions/<hex>.log` that `runner_exec.open_output` creates. In order:

1. The server takes the time, then runs the action.
2. `record`, once it answered: the log, then the note, `started` at step 1. A refusal (a 4xx, or a `ValueError` or
   library refusal raised) ran nothing and writes nothing, as the pages' "a 4xx wrote nothing" says. A command that
   answered in the POST is ended at once: exit 0 for a 2xx or 3xx, 1 for a 5xx or any other raise, `UNKNOWN` for a
   504 or an answer that says its outcome is not known. A 202 start names its run in the note (`run`) and stays open;
   `watch` looks at that run every `POLL_SECONDS`, in a thread, until `settle` reads its end. A run that has no item of its
   own (a deck, a job) is kept on one holder item, `HOLDER`, made once as a done task, since `note.item` is NOT NULL.
   A command on an item keeps its record there too, naming the item in its label: a note on the item would change
   the revision its answer handed the page, and the item's notes are its own evidence.
3. `settle`: the run's own reader (`SETTLE`). A read that fails is no end: the record stays open.
4. `resume`, when the server starts: each open record is watched again, so a restart loses no run's end.

A server stopped inside a command that answers in the POST leaves no record of it: the record is written once it
answered. A journal that cannot be written (a satellite, a full disk) does not stop the command: the server log says
why.
