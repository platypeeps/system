"""The Work and Personal sweeps (sd:5096, sd:5097): one headless `claude -p` per realm, started from the Tasks page.

    python3 -m sd_dashboard.realm_sweep run work|personal             the sweep, now; one run per realm at a time
    python3 -m sd_dashboard.realm_sweep status work|personal [--json] the last run: running, its end, its log

    environment: XDG_STATE_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, SD_PACK_ROOT, CLAUDE_BIN, WORKSPACE_MCP_URL,
    REALM_SWEEP_SD (default sd), REALM_SWEEP_TIMEOUT (seconds, default 3600)

A run leaves three things and commits to no repository: a dated brief on the Briefs page (`<day> - Work sweep` or
`<day> - Personal sweep`) with the status and the changes since the last run; sd followups, one per action, deduped by
`--ref` and against the open items; and Gmail drafts, never sent. The HOA sweep is the hoa checkout's own
(`tools/sweep.py`), with its own prompt; `sweep.py` starts all three.

Sources:

- personal: the personal Google account's mail and its My Drive changes. `mail_query` leaves out the HOA aliases and
  `drive_exclude` the HOA shared Drives: the HOA sweep owns them.
- work: the work Google account's mail and Drive changes, Notion page changes, Jira issues assigned to, mentioning or
  watched by the operator, and GitHub pull requests and reviews requesting the operator, and mentions.

The filters are fleet settings (sd:5109), `sweep.<realm>.<name>` rows in the workflow database (`SETTINGS`), which the
Settings page edits under Sweeps. The account is the `google.accounts.<realm>.email` setting row, or without one that key
in the pack's machine config (`<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/sd-ai-command-pack/config.json`): the row first, as `sd config` reads a
fleet key. A failed database read fails the run: it is unknown, not unset.

The run has an exact allowlist, `--permission-mode dontAsk`, and never skips permission checks. Its MCP tools read
(`MCP_READS`); its one write is `draft_gmail_message`. No tool that sends, forwards or labels mail, writes Drive, Notion
or Jira, or comments on GitHub is allowed, and `DENIED` names them as well. Bash runs only `sd store items`,
`sd task show|note` and the realm's `sd task add`; Write reaches only the run folder. Each run loads its servers alone
(`--strict-mcp-config`): the Personal run workspace-mcp, the Work run also notion, jira and github (`WORK_MCP`), whose
credentials come from env.sh by name, never in argv or a file.

Steps, and what a stop between them leaves:

1. The lock, `<state>/sweep.lock`: a second run of the realm exits 3 and writes nothing. The model run inherits it
   (sd:5341), so a runner killed in step 3 leaves its model holding the lock, `status` reads it running, and no run
   starts beside it.
2. `<state>/last.json` as `running`, naming the run folder, the log, the brief and the pid. `status` reads a `running`
   record whose pid is gone as failed, so a stop from here on reads failed.
3. The model run, in `<state>/runs/<stamp>/`. Followups and drafts land as it goes; a stop leaves them without a brief.
   The next run finds them: a followup's `--ref` names one message or comment (or a file's version) and refuses a
   second add, and a reply a draft already gives gets no other.
4. The brief filed with `sd reports brief add --replace`. A stop before it leaves the brief in the run folder. Before
   its model, each run reads today's filed brief, if any, and keeps its changes, so a second run in a day replaces it
   with more; a read that failed for another reason than "no brief" stops the run there.
5. `last.json` as `done` or `failed`, with the exit code, the reason, and the sources read (`read`) and not (`gaps`).
   Each source keeps its own checkpoint (`checkpoints`): only a done run moves one on, and only for a source its
   reply names on its `READ:` line. A failed run and an unread source keep the older time. A source's first attempt
   writes its start, seven days before that run, to the record before the model, and it stays until a run reads it.

Exit codes: 0 done, 3 another run of the realm holds the lock, 1 failed.

Facts:
- Google account: {account}. Every Gmail and Drive call names it as user_google_email.
- Run folder: {folder}. Write files only there.
- Brief file: {brief}
- Today's brief so far: {earlier}
- Followup reference: {realm}-sweep:<source>-<id>

Since, by source. Read what changed in each source after its own time; a source an earlier run could not read keeps
the time that run had. A source marked "not configured" is skipped and named under Gaps.
{since}

The sweep's settings:
{filters}

{steps}
Followups. For each action the operator owns, keep one sd item:
- Read the open items once: `sd store items --open --json`.
- An open item that covers the action gets a note: `sd task note <id> "<what changed>" --kind followup`.
- Otherwise file one: `{add} --ref {realm}-sweep:<source>-<id> "<title>"`. <source> is gmail, drive, notion, jira or
  github. <id> names the one message or comment that asks, never its whole thread, file, page, issue or pull request,
  which can ask again later: a Gmail message id; a Jira issue key and comment id (`ABC-12/10023`); a GitHub
  owner/repo#number and comment or review id (`owner/repo#7/123`); a Notion comment id. Where nothing finer than the
  whole asks (a Drive file, a Notion page, a Jira assignment, a review request), add `@` and its modified time
  (`<file id>@2026-10-18T09:00:00Z`). A second action in that same message or comment adds `.2`, `.3`. A refusal
  that names an existing item means this one occurrence is filed already: leave it.

Drafts. For each reply the operator owes, save one Gmail draft in {account} with draft_gmail_message, in the
thread it answers. Search `in:drafts` first and skip a reply a draft already gives; a thread with a draft for
another message still gets this one. Never send.

Brief. Write {brief} with the Write tool. It opens with these three lines:
---
series: {series}
---
Then `## Status` (what needs the operator now, most urgent first), `## Changes` (one short part per source, since its
time above), `## Followups` (each sd item filed or noted, with its id), `## Drafts` (each draft saved, by subject) and
`## Gaps` (each source not read, and why). If today's brief so far is a file, read it and keep its changes. Plain
sentences, no tables, no message bodies quoted at length.

Reply with a short report. Its second-last line is `READ: ` and the sources you read in full, comma-separated (for
example `READ: mail, drive`); leave out every source you skipped or read only in part. Its last line is `RESULT: ok`,
or `RESULT: failed, <step>: <reason>` when a step could not finish. A source that could not be read is a gap in the
brief, not a failure.
