"""Places: the HOA, Home and realm place pages' Tasks, Briefs and Reports views, and the area rule Tasks' Realm
filter uses for HOA and Home.

Each view reads its own document: `/api/<area>/tasks`, `/api/<area>/briefs` and `/api/<area>/reports`, built here
from readers that already exist, with no store of its own. HOA's Tasks is the exception: its rows are
`/api/hoa`'s items (`hoa_screen`, ranked by urgency), which the page reads anyway for its annunciator and badge; they
are the same `tasks_screen._rows` (sd:5671).

**Which rows are an area's.**

- An item is HOA when its repo is the hoa checkout (`hoa_screen.checkout`), and Home when it has no repo: the
  operator files personal and home items without one. A report is in neither: its family's Reports view holds it.
  `area_of` is that rule, and Tasks' rows carry its answer as `area`, so Tasks' HOA and Home realms hold the place
  pages' Tasks rows.
- A brief is the area's when its repo is the area's checkout, or its series, lower-cased with spaces as hyphens, is a
  job of the area's report family (`series_job`): briefs always name a registered repo, so Home has only the second.
- A report is the area's when its job is in the area's report family. The family is the `dashboard.report_families` line
  whose key is the area's (`reports_screen.families`).

**A realm's place page (sd:5663).** A realm whose id is also a `dashboard.report_families` key is a place, at
`/places?realm=<id>`, its views at `/api/place/<id>/<view>`. Its Tasks are the open items `realm_of` puts in it, as
Tasks' Realm filter; its Briefs are those whose repo is in it or whose series is a job of its family; its Reports are its
family's. `realm_places` says which realms are places, for the rail: a realm or family line that did not read makes none.

**Which realm a row is in (sd:5064).** Tasks' Realm filter, Personal, Work and the others: the `dashboard.realms` setting row
(sd:5109; Settings edits it) names each realm and the checkout path globs that are its (`realms`); `realm_of` gives a row the first realm whose glob matches its repo path. A
row with no repo, or a repo no line claims, is Personal; a report is in no realm. Without a readable row a repo row's
realm is unknown (None), so Personal holds only the rows with no repo and the page says why.

**What is not read.** A missing hoa checkout, family or list makes the view `unknown` with the reason and the line to
add, never an empty list; a family list that did not read makes it `error`. Nothing here writes.
