"""`sd shadow sync` from the dashboard (sd:2207): one server thread, one run at a time.

The operator ruled option (a) on 2026-10-03 (sd:2207 #8765): a thread calls
`sd_db.sync_shadow` once per tracker in `sd_db.TRACKERS`, as the pack's
`sd shadow sync` does, with one 120-second deadline for the whole run instead of
the library's 600 per tracker. GitHub gets what is left of it as `max_seconds`.
Jira ignores `max_seconds`, so its transport refuses a request once the deadline
has passed; a request already in flight can still take Jira's 30-second timeout.
A request while a run is live is refused, not queued.

Every `sync_shadow` holds the library's shadow-sync lock (`sd_db.shadow_sync.sync_lock`),
so this run and `sd shadow sync` (the nightly job, a terminal) never collect at
once; the second gets `SyncBusy`. A start tries the lock first and answers 409
while another holder has it. The lock is the hub's: a satellite refuses (HubOnly),
before the run would reopen the hub's file path from `PRAGMA database_list`.

The run opens its own writer on the database the request's writer opened: the
request's connection closes when the POST answers, long before the run ends.
