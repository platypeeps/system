"""Health's cleanup writes (sd:3393, sd:5105): prune registrations, delete merged branches, remove build output and
remove merged worktrees.

The page posts `/api/health/cleanup` with the row it showed and that row's `revision`. The row names the action:

  gone:<checkout>   `git -C <checkout> worktree prune -v`, for a checkout under the fleet root whose registrations
                    point at a directory that is gone. Its subject is every registration that is not live.
  br:<registered>   `git -C <repo> branch -d <name>`, once per merged branch, for a registered repository.
                    Its subject is each deletable branch by name and tip.
  build:merged      removes `target/`, `node_modules/` and `.venv/` from registered worktrees that are merged into
                    origin/HEAD and clean. Its subject is each such worktree's path, head, status and folders.
  wt:merged         removes the registered worktrees at a head the lane merged (sd:5105), with their branch here
                    and on origin. Its subject is each such worktree's path, head, branches and whether it can go.

A merged worktree goes in four steps, each checked again just before it, in an order that leaves the tree on disk
until the last one, so a stop between any two leaves it in the next read, which finishes the rest:
`push --force-with-lease=refs/heads/<b>:<head> origin --delete <b>` when origin's branch is at the merged head,
`checkout --detach` in the tree, `update-ref -d refs/heads/<b> <head>`, and `git worktree remove <path>` without
`--force`, which refuses uncommitted or untracked files on its own. A branch that moved here or on origin, a process
working in the tree, or files that are not build output keep the tree, and the answer says why.

Each write reads its subject again first and refuses a digest that differs from the page's (409): evidence from
another row, or a subject that changed since the read, writes nothing. Then each step keeps git's own guard:
`worktree prune` leaves a locked or present directory's registration, and `branch -d` refuses a branch that is not
merged into its upstream or HEAD. Build output is removed only after the worktree is read again, just before its
folders go: the same head, still in origin/HEAD, and `git status --porcelain` empty.

Outcomes follow `queue_screen.move`: a refusal that wrote nothing is a `ValueError` (400) or a `StaleItem` (409), and
so is a write where every step was refused. A step whose result is not known (a git call that did not answer, a folder
removal that stopped part way, a check before or after a step that could not be read) answers 502 with
`outcome: unknown` and what did land; the page reads Health again. When some steps landed, a step git or a check
refused is a definite answer: the write answers 200 and names it, with its reason.
