"""Download from Vantaca and Download from Mission (sd:5626): one click on the HOA page opens the source's portal in a
Claude Chrome session, waits there for the operator to log in, then runs the hoa checkout's own download.

    python3 -m sd_dashboard.hoa_download run vantaca|mission <hoa checkout>

    environment: XDG_STATE_HOME, CLAUDE_BIN

The download steps are the checkout's, not this module's (`SOURCES`): `tools/vantaca-pull.py` and
`tools/mission/mission.sh export`, each one `claude -p --chrome` that stops with exit 3 on a login page. The portal's
address is the first `https://` link in section 2 of that run's prompt, so no address is kept here.

`start` answers `POST /api/hoa/download {"source"}` through `sweep.spawn`: the source's lock, `<state>/lock`, then this
module's `run` detached, its output in `<state>/start.log`, and 202. `status` is `/api/hoa`'s `downloads` part.
`run`, in steps, and what a stop between them leaves:

1. `<state>/last.json` as `running`, phase `opening`, with the runner's pid. From here a stopped runner reads failed;
   a session it started still holds the lock, so no second start opens another tab beside it, until that session's
   own alarm (`alarmed`) ends it.
2. The login wait: one `claude -p --chrome` with an exact allowlist (`allowed_tools`), no shell and no form tool, that
   opens the page in its own tab. On a login page it prints `STATUS: waiting for login`, and the phase becomes
   `waiting`; it reads the page again every 30 seconds, up to 15 minutes, and never types. `RESULT: signed in`, as the
   last RESULT line of a successful result event, goes on; anything else ends the run there, before any download, as
   `unavailable` or `failed`.
3. The download: the checkout's command, phase `downloading`. Exit 0 is `done`, 3 `unavailable`, any other `failed`,
   each with the command's last output line. The command keeps its own lock and its own landing.
4. `last.json` as `done`, `unavailable` or `failed`, with the exit code and the reason.

Exit codes: 0 done, 3 not possible now (signed out, no browser, another run), 1 failed.
