"""The dashboard's default UI: the design source's shell, and the pages built on it so far (sd:2163).

The design source is ui-design `products/system/` (`design.md`, `designs/pages/`
and `foundation/`); `static/` holds its shell, tokens and fonts as the files the
dashboard policy allows (`default-src 'self'`: no inline style or script, no
font from another origin). `static/shell.js` marks each change from the
reference with `build:`.

A page is one HTML file beside this module, registered by its own module in
`pages/` (sd:2418): `PAGES`, `SECTIONS`, the classic screens it keeps, its API
routes (`api`, `action`) and the old screens it took the path of (`old`) are
built from that enumeration, so a port edits no line here. `dashboard.sh pages`
prints the map. The assets are what `static/` holds, enumerated from the
directory when the module loads: a file added there is served, and nothing
outside it can be.

Each asset is linked as `/ui/<name>?v=<digest>`, from `VERSIONS`, the map of
digests computed when this module loads (sd:2141): `page` adds the query to the
page's links, and `asset` adds it to a stylesheet's `url(...)` references, so a
font change changes the stylesheet's digest too. `sd_dashboard.caching` says
when the server may cache an answer for good. `/ui/sections.js` is the one
exception: the server writes it on each request (`sections`), unversioned and
`no-store`, because it carries every page's rail badge (sd:3446, `Badges`).

Since sd:2163 the pages are served at the root (`/today`) and the assets under
`/ui/`, a prefix no v1 route uses; v1 keeps `/static/`. A `/v2/` address that
names a page or an asset redirects to its new one (`moved`).
