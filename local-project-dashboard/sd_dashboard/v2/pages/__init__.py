"""The v2 pages, one module each (sd:2418).

Each module beside this one defines `PAGE`, a `Page`: the rail section it
fills, its routes and HTML file, its API routes, and any old screen it keeps in
the palette or takes the path of. The modules are enumerated when this package
loads, as `v2` enumerates `static/`, so a port adds a module here and edits no
shared line: `v2.PAGES`, `v2.SECTIONS`, `/ui/sections.js`, the server's API
dispatch and the old-screen routes are all built from `PAGES`.

A module imports its screen on first use, inside the function that reads it,
as `server.py` did: enumerating the pages loads no collector.
