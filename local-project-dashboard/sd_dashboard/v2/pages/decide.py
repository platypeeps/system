"""Decide (sd:5781): what waits on a ruling, in two views. Decisions (sd:3012, Today's view until sd:5781) lists each open
question note: `/api/decisions` reads them and `/api/decisions/answer` records a ruling (`decisions`). Scoring (sd:3709,
the Review page until sd:5781) is the labelling queue: `/api/review` lists the open batches and their open questions; a
label posts `/api/review/rule` and its undo `/api/review/withdraw`; a batch's labels download from
`/api/review/<item>/export`. Each is `sd_db.review`, the code `sd-db review` runs (`review_screen`). `/review`, the old
address, serves this page, which opens it on Scoring with its query (decide.js)."""
