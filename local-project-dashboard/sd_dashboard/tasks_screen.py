"""Tasks: the rows and the Details reading behind the default UI's Tasks page (sd:2124).

The page is `v2/tasks.html`; it holds no rows. It reads two JSON documents,
both built here from the reads v1 already makes, so the port adds no second
query of the store:

- `/api/tasks` is `document`: every row `reads.backlog_items` returns for v1
  /backlog (unparked open items, and `done` for the week), then the open items
  the nightly prune parked (`parked`, its stamp; None on every other row), each with the
  revision a write sends back and the statuses `workflow.allowed_statuses`
  accepts for it, so the board refuses a move for the reason the library
  would, before it posts. Each row carries its `reads.age_bucket` key and the
  document names the buckets (`ages`), so the page's age filter is the one
  Operations' histogram counts with (sd:2589). Each row also carries whether `workflow.edit_item`
  takes its fields (`_edit_capability`), so Edit, P2, recurrence and a
  matrix drop are off, with the library's reason, where the edit would fail.
  The document's `attention` is the page's rail badge (sd:3446, `_attention`).
  A vault base row (sd:3977) also carries its `base` (`fields.kind`), `stage` and `score`; every other row has None.
- `/api/tasks/<id>` is `details`: what `sd task show <id> --json` prints
  (`item`, `notes`, `revision`, from `workflow.item_state`), split into the
  status history and the other notes as v1's item page splits them, plus the
  item's assignments (`reads.item_assignments`, with the cancel capability
  and revision `sd assignments cancel` checks), a work
  item's relink and cancel availability (`progress.work_controls`) and its
  external context (`reads.item_shadow` and `progress.tracker_freshness`,
  v1's "External context" block), or `null` when the item has none. A vault base row's
  `base` is its stage moves, declared fields, body and mirror section (`_base`), or `null` for any other row.
- `from_backlog` is where a v1 `/backlog` address goes since sd:2356 retired
  it: the same `/tasks` view with the query v1 read, so a bookmark or an old
  link keeps its filters.

Every write the page makes goes through a route `server.action_route`
already answered for v1: status, edit (priority, due, recurrence), note
resolve, work relink and cancel, task cancel (`/cancel-task`, the bulk
Close of sd:3012), and Unpark (the edit route with `parked_at: null`, sd:3012).
Fix (`/fix`, sd:3456) is new, and Reports and Today post it too: `fix_session`
starts a herdr session for the item and adds a note. Draft email (`/draft-email`, sd:3463) is Tasks' alone:
`email_draft` has claude write an email about a task or followup and saves it as a Gmail draft, never sent, with a note
naming it. File GitHub issue and File Jira issue (`/file-issue`, sd:5103) are `issue_filing`'s: each row carries
`issue_targets`, where each would file or why it is off, and `issue_link`, the issue its ref names. Nothing here writes.
